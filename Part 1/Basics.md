Everyone loves cats, right? They are adorable fluffy little beings that enjoy smashing things and not obeying anyone. Well, in this series we'll make an assumption that suddenly they will listen to all commands given the magical phrase, `display: flex;`. "Understanding Flexbox with Cats" will use the analogy of `cats and boxes` to teach concepts like the CSS box model, flexbox positioning, and some valuable tips on the use of containers(aka "boxes", aka "divs"). 

In part one, we will mainly focus on a reader's thorough understanding of how flexbox positioning works with multiple containers. Covering margins, borders, paddings, relative width & height, as well as flex properties like `flex-direction`, `align-self`, and `justify-content`.
